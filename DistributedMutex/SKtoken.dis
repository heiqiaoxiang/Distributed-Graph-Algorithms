Suzuki and Kasami's generalized
-------------------------------

I followed a description of the algorithm found on: http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/aos.f01/l17tokenDMX.pdf
NOTE: Some of the comments seen in the code are copied from the above PDF. 

However, below is a description of the algorithm from Annie Liu's course website (on Google Sites)
(This is not the one I followed, see above link for the version of the algorithm I used.)

 token holds:
 
   served: array of intergers, where served[j] is the number of requests
           made by Pj that have been served, initialized to 0.
   pending: list of requests, of form (pid, issued), received by P0 that
            have not been served yet, initialized to [].
 
 Pi decentralized from two parts above:
 
   issued: array of integers, where issued[j] is the number of requests
      made by Pj, initialized to 0.
   token_held: boolean, initialized to false.
   token_present: boolean, initialized to false.
   pending: list of requests, of form (pid, issued), received by Pi that
            have not been served yet, initialized to [].
 
   request:                                                     Pi
     issued[i] := issued[i]+1                                   Pi
     send (request,issued,i) to all processes (including self). Pi
